## Getting started:

Follow these instructions to get the Foodies up and running on your local machine.

- Prerequisites:

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:


1)Install Git: If you haven't already, you'll need to install Git on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://git-scm.com/downloads

2)Open a Terminal or Command Prompt: Depending on your operating system, open a terminal on Linux/macOS or a command prompt on Windows.


1. Navigate to the Directory Where You Want to Clone the Repository: Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where you want to store the Foodies.com repository. For example, if you want to clone it into your "Projects" directory, you can use:

```bash
cd /path/to/Projects

```




2. Clone the Repository: Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone it. In this case, the URL is https://github.com/danishsk4/Foodies.com. Run the following command:


```bash
git clone https://github.com/danishsk4/Foodies.com

```
This will initiate the cloning process, and Git will download all the files from the repository to your local machine.
3. Access the Cloned Repository: You can now navigate into the cloned "Foodies.com" directory using the cd command:

```bash
cd Foodies.com
```

4. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install

```

1. Start the development server:
2. Open your web browser and visit "http://localhost:3000" to view the Foodies Clone.
